Description: Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based
        multiple testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods)
        for controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized
        family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the
        proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate
        (FDR).  Several choices of bootstrap-based null distribution
        are implemented (centered, centered and scaled,
        quantile-transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are
        available. Tests based on a variety of t- and F-statistics
        (including t-statistics based on regression parameters from
        linear and survival models as well as those based on
        correlation parameters) are included.  When probing hypotheses
        with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster
        null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero
        and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector
        influence function.  Results are reported in terms of adjusted
        p-values, confidence regions and test statistic cutoffs. The
        procedures are directly applicable to identifying
        differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.
